---

**YOUR POLISHING INSTRUCTIONS:**

**1. PACE AND RHYTHM**
- Break up long paragraphs (more than 5-6 sentences)
- Alternate descriptions with short emotional beats (1-2 sentences)
- Vary sentence length to create rhythm
- Use short paragraphs for tense moments

**2. DIALOGUE WITH SUBTEXT**
- Eliminate direct explanations in dialogue
- Add pauses, gestures, things left unsaid
- Characters should rarely say everything directly
- Show non-verbal cues: glances, silence, tone
- Remove exposition from dialogue ("As you know, Bob...")

**3. MOTIVATION AND DOUBT**
- Insert internal struggle in key decisions
- Show doubts, memories, fear before choices
- Don't jump instantly to action — let character think
- Show the cost of decision BEFORE it's made

**4. ANTI-REPETITION**
- Remove identical words in adjacent paragraphs
- For recurring concepts (darkness, fire, fear) use varied metaphors
- Vary synonyms
- Don't repeat the same sentence structure consecutively

**5. EMOTIONAL ANCHORS**
- In each important scene, leave a small "human moment"
- A memory, smell, gesture, detail that connects reader to character
- Sensory details: not just sight, but sound, smell, touch
- One concrete image is better than three abstract ones

**6. LAYERS OF PERCEPTION**
- Show difference between what character sees and how they interpret it
- Light shade of self-deception or bias
- Subjectivity of perception: one sees threat, another sees opportunity
- Internal monologue can contradict actions

**7. FINAL POLISH**
- Choose richer and more varied vocabulary
- Avoid clichés and overused phrases
- Maintain consistent style throughout chapter
- Make text flow smoothly, without jarring transitions between scenes
- Check that transitions between paragraphs are logical

**CRITICAL WORD BANS:**
- NEVER use "obsidian" or any derivatives (obsidian-like, obsidian's, etc.)
- NEVER use "thorn" or "thorne" or any derivatives (thorns, thorny, etc.)
- Replace obsidian with: "black stone", "dark walls", "stone", "dark rock"
- Replace thorn/thorne with: "spike", "sharp point", "barb", be specific
- This is ABSOLUTE - scan entire text and remove ALL mentions

**🔧 CRITICAL: UNFILLED SLOT CLEANUP:**
If you see any unfilled markers like [SLOT_NAME], [DESCRIPTION_X], [DIALOGUE_X], [ACTION_X], [INTERNAL_X] in the text:
- These are ERRORS from the generation process
- You MUST either:
  a) Remove them completely if the text flows fine without them
  b) Replace them with appropriate brief content that fits the context
- DO NOT leave any [BRACKET_MARKERS] in the final text
- This is MANDATORY - scan the entire chapter for any remaining markers

**IMPORTANT:**
- Preserve all plot events and dialogue
- Don't change the meaning of scenes
- Don't add new scenes or characters
- Focus on QUALITY OF DELIVERY, not content
- This is final polish, not rewriting

**RETURN:**
Polished version of the chapter. Only chapter text, no comments.`;
